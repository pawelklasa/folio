          <p class="work-text">The aim was to design a new site to integrate within the current corporate site, http://www.btp.police.uk/ allowing a cleaner journey, less repetition and providing more engagement for the candidate. To allow full integration the site was to be built using BTP's software. As the use of internet via desktop-based computers is dropping rapidly the BTP careers destination site was developed for viewing across a range of platforms without compromising any aspect of the visual design. In short, it was to offer the best in class 'responsive design', providing optimum user experience on the users' device of choice. The new look and feel site was built to time and budget incorporating new imagery and copy giving a more contemporary look and feel and enhancing the candidate journey.

          <p class="work-text">"Raising the profile of BTP is key to our attraction strategy and the website re-design has been a critical element of this process. We were keen to demonstrate the breadth of roles and the diverse nature of the organisation, whilst promoting BTP as an 'employer of choice" -Monique Myers, Recruitment Manager, British Transport Police.

          <p class="work-title">The Idea</p>
          <p class="work-text">British Transport Police provided allot of usefull information which helped us understand more about the day to day duties The Officers face. With that came some really interesting statistics whch helped us understand how big and important the force really is.
            The problem BTP officers face is that they are less visible or recognisable as a seperate police force. This website aims to solve that problem by placing some of the officers in a familiar environment backed by some remarkable statistics.
