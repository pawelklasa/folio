          <p class="work-text">Launched as a challenge for applicants for new roles at GCHQ.  It needed to entice the next generation 
            of technical talent.  Whilst being a puzzle, the idea is also the ultimate test for would be code crackers.  It is designed 
            to find those who have the intellectual ability but not necessarily the practical experience of working in the field of cyber 
            security.
            The challenge was to crack a series of cryptic codes. The brainteaser consisted of 29 blocks of 5 letters which 
            candidates had to decipher into 5 answers.  The answers then lead the applicant to an online 'treasure hunt' (with the latest 
            technical gadgets as prizes up for grabs) which hopefuls have six weeks to complete.
