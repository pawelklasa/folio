            <p class="work-title">The problem</p>

            <p class="work-text">I was hired by TalkTalk in 2014 to work on their first responsive Homepage. 
              I have created a few early designs and soon realised I will need a design system if I want to 
              keep consistency in design and in build across TalkTalk's online products. There are vast 
              independent sections of TalkTalk's website such as 'Help & Support', 'Community', 'My Account', 
              'TV & News Portal'. All those independent sections had to be re-designed and re-built. This was 
              a huge task that required certain level of automation in Design but also in Front-end implementation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="work-text">This required entirely new strategy and planning. The most challenging part was 
              getting that elusive 'Buy-in' from our senior stakeholders and The Business in general to secure the funding.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="work-text">I have partnered up with our Principle Developer and Architect to come up with a strategy 
              and most efficient way of implementing a design system.
              </p>
              <br>
            
          </div>

          <div class="grey-background">

              <p class="work-title-right">Our approach</p>
  
              <p class="work-text-right">TalkTalk is a budget Internet Service Provider and we knew we will have to rely on 
                frameworks to keep the budget as low as possible. After extensive research and tests, we have decided 
                to go with AngularJS and Bootstrap. Our vision was to treat TalkTalk's online products as independent 
                Single Page Web Applications, supported by already established responsive framework re-styled with 
                TalkTalk's brand guidelines in mind. We were asked to create a working prototype within a month and 
                present it to the stakeholders.
              </p>
              <br>
              
            </div>

            <div class="image-holder"><img src="../../img/talktalk/page-04.png" class="image"></div>

            <div class="grey-background">

              <p class="work-title">Prototyping</p>
  
              <p class="work-text">Building a responsive Single Page Web Application was an untrodden path at TalkTalk, 
                this gave us technical and creative freedom to set principles and best practices in design and front-end 
                implementation. We started from researching and defining UX and UI guidelines for each component we have 
                set out to create for our prototype. This consisted of navigation, buttons, footer, general page styling, 
                graphy and iconography. One of the requirements was to adhere to AA accessibility standards enabling 
                screen readers and many other functionalities required for disabled users to be able to access the website. 
              </p>
              <br>

              <p class="work-text">I have created cut-outs of all the components we wanted for our prototype in all 4 breaking 
                points. This was handy when presenting the concept to the rest of the business. This allowed better understanding 
                by interaction. Seeing how singular components stack into larger modules and then into pages allowed all involved 
                to imagine how this would work in practice.  
              </p>

              <p class="work-title-right">The Design and Front-end stage</p>
  
              <p class="work-text-right">I have used Sketch as my main design tool. There were many advantages for using it. Sketch 
                integrates allot of useful plugins created by ever growing community. It had great design library integration 
                possibilities. The files unlike Photoshop were small in size thanks to vector graphics. With integrated pattern 
                library, I was able to amend my designs with ease and almost instantaneously across all projects. Some examples below:

            <div class="image-holder"><img src="../../img/talktalk/page-06.png" class="image"></div>

            <div class="white-background">
  
              <p class="work-text">The Continuous sign-off process ensured we were able to move onto another component and make sure 
                there's no surprises or major changes later in the project. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p class="work-text">In total, we have created 68 unique components that are 
                  used today for building pages and customer journeys at TalkTalk. This library is constantly updated and improved. Each 
                  component has its own dedicated page with UX and UI writ-up and a code snippet for developers. It allowed us to share 
                  this library with our external partners and within many branches at TalkTalk.
