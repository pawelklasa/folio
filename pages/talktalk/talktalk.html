          <p class="work-title">The problem</p>
          <p class="work-text">I was hired by TalkTalk in 2014 to work on their first responsive Homepage. I have created a few early designs and soon realised I will need a design system if I want to keep the consistency in design and in build across TalkTalk's online products. There are vast independent sections of TalkTalk's website such as 'Help & Support', 'Community', 'My Account', 'TV & News Portal'.
            All those independent sections had to be re-designed and re-built. This was a huge task that required certain level of automation in Design but also in Front-end implementation. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="work-text">This required entirely new strategy and planning. The most challenging part was getting that elusive Buy-in from our senior steakholders and The Business in general to secure the funding.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="work-text">I have partnered up with our Principle Developer and Architect to come up with a strategy and most efficient way of implementing a design system.</p>
          <br>

          <p class="work-title">Our approach</p>
          <p class="work-text">TalkTalk is a budget Internet Service Provider and we new we will have to rely on frameworks to keep the budget as low as possible. After extensive research and tests we have decided to go with AngularJS and Bootstrap.
            Our vision was to treat TalkTalk's online products as independent Single Page Web Applications, supported by already established responsive framework re-styled with TalkTalk's brand guidelines in mind. We were asked to create a working prototype within a month and present it to the steakholders.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p class="work-title">Prototyping</p>
          <p class="work-text">
              Building a responsive Single Page Web Application was an untrodden path at TalkTalk, this gave us technical and creative freedom to set principles and best preactices in design and front-end implementation. We started from researching and defigning UX and UI guidelines for each component we have set out to create for our prototype. This consisted of navigation, buttons, footer, general page styling, typography and iconography.
              One of the requirements was to adhere to AA accessibility stadards enabling screen readers and many other funcionality required for disabled users to be able to access the website.<br>
          </p>
          <br>

          <p class="work-text">
            At this stage I've created a simple UX library in Axure. This was a list of components and rules concerning usability, accessibility and usage. It also served as a User Experience documentation hosted online for anyone to view and understand how our compenents work.

          <p class="work-title">The Design and Front-end stage</p>
          <p class="work-text">
            I have used Sketch as my main design tool. There were many advantages for using it. Sketch integrates allot of usefull plugins created bu ever growing community. It had great design library intergration posibilities. The files unlike Photoshop were small in size thanks to vector graphics. 
            With integrated pattern library I was able to amend my designs with ease and almost instantaniously across all projects. I have also

          <br>

          <p class="work-text">
              Everytime a component was created I would present the UX and UI Designs but also simple HTML/CSS prototype to our stakeholders. This ensured we Were able to move on fto another component and make sure there's no surpirses or major changes later in the project.
