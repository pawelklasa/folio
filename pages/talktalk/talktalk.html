          <p class="work-title">The problem</p>
          <p class="work-text">I was hired by TalkTalk in 2014 to work on their first responsive Homepage. I have created a few 
            early designs and soon realised I will need a design system if I want to keep the consistency in design and in build 
            across TalkTalk's online products. There are vast independent sections of TalkTalk's website such as 'Help & Support', 
            'Community', 'My Account', 'TV & News Portal'.
            All those independent sections had to be re-designed and re-built. This was a huge task that required certain level of 
            automation in Design but also in Front-end implementation. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="work-text">This required entirely new strategy and planning. The most challenging part was getting that elusive 
            'Buy-in' from our senior steakholders and The Business in general to secure the funding.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="work-text">I have partnered up with our Principle Developer and Architect to come up with a strategy and most 
            efficient way of implementing a design system.</p>
          <br>

          <p class="work-title">Our approach</p>
          <p class="work-text">TalkTalk is a budget Internet Service Provider and we new we will have to rely on frameworks to keep 
            the budget as low as possible. After extensive research and tests we have decided to go with AngularJS and Bootstrap.
            Our vision was to treat TalkTalk's online products as independent Single Page Web Applications, supported by already 
            established responsive framework re-styled with TalkTalk's brand guidelines in mind. We were asked to create a working 
            prototype within a month and present it to the steakholders.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p class="work-title">Prototyping</p>
          <p class="work-text">
              Building a responsive Single Page Web Application was an untrodden path at TalkTalk, this gave us technical and creative 
              freedom to set principles and best preactices in design and front-end implementation. We started from researching and 
              defigning UX and UI guidelines for each component we have set out to create for our prototype. This consisted of navigation, 
              buttons, footer, general page styling, typography and iconography.
              One of the requirements was to adhere to AA accessibility stadards enabling screen readers and many other funcionality 
              required for disabled users to be able to access the website.<br>
          </p>
          <br>

          <p class="work-text">
              I have created cutouts of all the components we wanted for our prototype in all 4 breaking points. This was handy when presenting 
              the concept to the rest of the business. This allowed better understanding by interaction. Seeing how singular components stakc 
              into larger modules and then into pages allowed all involved to imagine how this would work in practice.<br>
          </p>

          <p class="work-text">
            At this stage I've created a simple UX library in Axure. This was a list of components and rules concerning usability, 
            accessibility and usage. It also served as a User Experience documentation hosted online for anyone to view and understand 
            how our compenents work and should behave.

          <p class="work-title">The Design and Front-end stage</p>
          <p class="work-text">
            I have used Sketch as my main design tool. There were many advantages for using it. Sketch integrates allot of usefull plugins 
            created by ever growing community. It had great design library intergration posibilities. The files unlike Photoshop were 
            small in size thanks to vector graphics. 
            With integrated pattern library I was able to amend my designs with ease and almost instantaniously across all projects.

          <p class="work-text">
              The Continous dign-off process ensured we were able to move onto another component and make sure there's no surpirses or 
              major changes later in the project.

          <p class="work-title">Finishing touches</p>
          <p class="work-text">
              In total we have created 68 unique components that are used today for building pages and cuntomer journeys at TalkTalk. This library
              is constantly updated and improved. Each component has it's own dedicated page with UX and UI writ-up and a code snippet for developers. 
              It allowed us to share this library with our external partners and withing many branches at TalkTalk.
